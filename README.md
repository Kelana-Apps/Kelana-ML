# Kelana-ML
Welcome to the Kelana Machine Learning Documentation! Kelana simplifies travel planning with AI by combining TensorFlow-based Content-Based Filtering, Neural Networks, and optimization techniques like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Here are the key features of Kelana:
- Personalized Itineraries: Tailored travel plans based on user preferences.
- Budget-Friendly Plans: Flexible pricing options.
- Optimal Travel Times: Suggestions for the best times to visit attractions.

## Features
Kelana uses AI to generate travel recommendations based on:
1. Optimization of Shortest Routes:
Kelana utilizes the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) to determine the most efficient route for visiting multiple tourist destinations without revisiting any location. This ensures optimal time management in travel planning.
3. Recommendation System:
Kelana's recommendation system is driven by a Neural Network-based Content-Based Filtering (CBF) approach. The system analyzes features and user-selected criteria to recommend destinations tailored to individual preferences.
